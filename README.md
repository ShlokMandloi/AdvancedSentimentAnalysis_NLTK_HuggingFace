# Advanced Sentiment Analysis with NLTK and Hugging Face

This project demonstrates advanced sentiment analysis techniques using Python, focusing on the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Hugging Face's Transformers. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that guides through the process of analyzing sentiment in text data, leveraging both traditional NLP approaches and cutting-edge transformer models.

## Features

- Data importing and preprocessing, specifically designed for sentiment analysis tasks.
- Introduction to sentiment analysis with NLTK, including VADER sentiment scoring.
- Utilization of Hugging Face's transformers for sentiment analysis with a pre-trained Roberta model.
- Comparative analysis of sentiment scores obtained from VADER and Roberta models.

## Dataset

The project uses the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset, showcasing how to import and preprocess it for advanced sentiment analysis.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
